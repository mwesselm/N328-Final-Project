	    <p> For my final project I debated what topic I wanted to use. Initially I considered doing a motorsports visualization since I race dirt track cars, but given how close I live to Indianapolis I decided to focus on a more traditional sport. When I was first researching data for this project, I was simultaneously watching one of the Indianapolis Colts’ home games, which inspired me to tailor my project to that specific team and their home field of Lucas Oil Stadium. <br>My visualization examined the correlation between the game year and the average home game attendance for that particular year. The data itself was obtained from the years 2008 through 2022, since 2008 was the year Lucas Oil Stadium was built and the 2023 season is currently ongoing. To aid in my visualization, I noted that Lucas Oil Stadium has a maximum seating capacity of 70,000. The question I sought out to answer was has the average Indianapolis Colts home game attendance increased or decreased significantly over the last 5 years. The reason why my question focused on the prior 5 years is because in 2019, Andrew Luck retired from being one of the more successful and talented quarterbacks the Indianapolis Colts have had. Since his retirement, I feel like the team has struggled to maintain good performance and consistency, and I was curious if their lack of success was negatively affecting fan attendance at home games. The colors for my visualization were extremely easy to select since the Indianapolis Colts have three team colors, which are blue, black and white. I used blue for the primary background color of my visualization so that it was the most prevalent, and I used black for the data point symbols and text. Finally, I used white for the actually data corresponding with each data point symbol. <br>What I found was since 2018, the average attendance for an Indianapolis Colts home game has increased every year except for the year 2020, which was an obvious outlier due to the Covid-19 pandemic taking place that year. It doesn’t seem that Andrew Luck’s retirement or the team’s less than ideal performance had any negative affect on home game attendance. It’s interesting to note that the biggest fluctuation in home game attendance actually occurred between the years 2017 and 2018, where average home game attendance dropped from 63,440 to 59,199, respectively. Seeing that the average home game attendance increased from 61,110 in 2019 to 62,475 in 2021 then increased again to 65,559 in 2022, I wonder if this effect was caused by how eager people were to attend public events in general after the pandemic. Regardless, it’s very obvious that Indianapolis Colts fans are both loyal and supportive regardless of how well the team performs. <br>Originally, I wanted to create an interactive visualization that compared the minimum ticket price, maximum ticket price, and average ticket price to the average home game attendance to see whether the team’s poor performance had a greater or lesser impact on attendance compared to the cost to go to a home game. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate any data sets with the appropriate ticket price information I would need to make that comparison, so I decided to pursue the visualization as presented.
